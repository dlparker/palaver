* Story Overview

** Title
Refactor FastAPI server to modular architecture with pluggable routers

** Story ID
003

** Stage
Prototype

** Status
Complete

* Description

Refactor the monolithic =scripts/server.py= into a modular architecture that supports:
- Pluggable routers for different server variants (status monitoring, draft editing UI, etc.)
- Reusable EventRouter component for event streaming
- Shared pipeline/database context across routers
- Simple composition pattern in scripts

This establishes the architectural foundation for future server variants while maintaining current functionality.

** Architecture Components

*** 1. EventRouter component (=src/palaver/fastapi/event_router.py=)
- Extract EventRouter class from =scripts/server.py=
- Keep as pure event routing logic (no FastAPI coupling)
- Reusable across different server implementations

*** 2. EventNetServer base class (=src/palaver/fastapi/server.py=)
- Manages FastAPI app lifecycle
- Handles pipeline startup/shutdown in lifespan context
- Provides shared context (pipeline, db, config) for routers
- Exposes =add_router()= method for composing functionality

*** 3. Event streaming router factory (=src/palaver/fastapi/routers/events.py=)
- =create_event_router(server)= factory function
- Creates FastAPI router with websocket endpoint
- Uses EventRouter from shared server context
- Returns APIRouter ready to include in app

*** 4. Status router (=src/palaver/fastapi/routers/status.py=) - Example
- =create_status_router(server)= factory function
- Provides basic =/status= and =/health= endpoints
- Demonstrates the router pattern for future extensions

*** 5. Refactored startup script (=scripts/server.py=)
- Keep argparse for command-line options
- Instantiate EventNetServer with config
- Compose routers: =server.add_router(create_event_router(server))=
- Simple, declarative server composition

** File Structure
#+begin_src
src/palaver/fastapi/
├── __init__.py
├── server.py          # EventNetServer base class
├── event_router.py    # EventRouter component (extracted)
└── routers/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── events.py      # create_event_router() factory
    └── status.py      # create_status_router() factory
#+end_src

** Acceptance Criteria

1. EventRouter extracted to standalone module, fully functional
2. EventNetServer base class manages pipeline lifecycle
3. Event streaming works via router factory composition
4. Status router provides basic health/status endpoints
5. =scripts/server.py= simplified to argparse + composition
6. All Story 002 functionality preserved (server-side filtering, VAD routing, speech-only chunks)
7. Existing test client (=scripts/test_client.py=) works without modification

* Constraints

- Maintain backward compatibility - existing server behavior unchanged
- Keep =scripts/server.py= simple - no business logic, just composition
- EventRouter should have no FastAPI dependencies (pure routing logic)
- Prototype stage quality: clean interfaces, basic tests, good separation of concerns
- Don't add features beyond current server - focus on refactoring structure
- Factory functions preferred over classes for router creation (simplicity)

- [X] Tests passing (manual testing successful, automated tests not required for Prototype stage)
- [X] Documentation updated (story document with implementation notes, inline docstrings)

** Retrospective

*** What went well

**** Technical implementation
- Modular architecture achieved clear separation of concerns
- EventRouter successfully extracted as pure routing logic (no FastAPI dependencies)
- EventNetServer provides clean base class for lifecycle management
- Factory function pattern (=create_event_router(server)=) simple and effective
- Router composition pattern very clean: =server.add_router(create_event_router(server))=
- 71% reduction in scripts/server.py demonstrates successful refactoring (348→101 lines)
- Backward compatibility maintained - existing test_client.py works without modification
- New /health and /status endpoints provide useful monitoring capabilities
- All Story 002 functionality preserved (server-side filtering, VAD routing, speech-only chunks)

**** Development process
- **Process correction**: User identified missing beads workflow, I corrected approach mid-stream
- **Beads workflow**: Creating issues with dependencies provided clear task ordering
- **AGENTS.md update**: Made workflow explicit to prevent future mistakes
- **Task granularity**: 7 well-scoped tasks easier to track than monolithic implementation
- **Stage upgrade**: Moving from POC to Prototype stage forced better architecture decisions
- **Dependency tracking**: =bd dep add= ensured correct implementation sequence
- **Session close protocol**: Followed complete git/beads sync workflow successfully

*** What could be improved

**** Technical debt (Prototype limitations)
- DefaultAPIWrapper still in scripts/ - should move to src/palaver for proper packaging
- Transitional sys.path manipulation in server.py to import from scripts is hacky
- No automated tests for new components (acceptable for Prototype, need for MVP)
- EventRouter uses =Any= type for websocket parameter (FastAPI coupling avoided but type safety lost)
- No router registration validation (can add incompatible routers without error)
- Status endpoint exposes internal structure (pipeline state) - may want abstraction layer later

**** Development process
- **Initial workflow mistake**: Should have created beads issues immediately, not tasks in story document
- **Documentation lag**: AGENTS.md wasn't explicit enough initially about beads requirement
- **Testing approach**: Manual testing sufficient for Prototype but need test strategy for MVP
- **Commit granularity**: Single large commit for all 7 tasks - could have committed incrementally

*** Lessons learned

**** Technical insights
- **Factory functions vs classes**: Factory pattern simpler than class-based router plugins
- **Shared context pattern**: Server providing =event_router= / =pipeline= access to routers works well
- **FastAPI router composition**: =app.include_router()= extremely clean for modular servers
- **Prototype stage quality**: Clean interfaces and good separation more important than comprehensive tests
- **Refactoring metrics**: Line count reduction (71%) good indicator of successful abstraction
- **Backward compatibility**: Zero changes to test client proves good architectural boundaries
- **Type annotations for documentation**: Even with =Any= types, docstrings compensate for clarity

**** Process insights
- **Beads as single source of truth**: Tasks must be in beads, not just story documents
- **Workflow documentation critical**: Without explicit AGENTS.md guidance, easy to forget beads
- **POC→Prototype transition**: Stage upgrade requires architectural thinking, not just code cleanup
- **Dependencies enforce quality**: =bd dep add= prevented implementing routers before EventNetServer
- **Meta-improvements during stories**: Fixing AGENTS.md mid-story prevented future mistakes
- **Session close checklist**: Following git→bd sync→commit→bd sync→push prevents lost work
- **Beads stats validation**: =bd stats= at end confirms all work tracked and closed

*** Final disposition

*Keep* - Successful architectural refactoring establishing foundation for future server variants.

The implementation successfully demonstrates:
- Modular architecture with pluggable routers (event streaming, status monitoring)
- Clean separation between EventRouter (pure routing) and EventNetServer (lifecycle)
- Factory function pattern for simple router composition
- Backward compatibility (existing client works without modification)
- Prototype stage quality (clean interfaces, good separation, basic testing)
- 71% reduction in scripts/server.py complexity

**Architectural foundation ready**: This refactoring enables future server variants:
- Draft editing UI server (would add draft management routers)
- Status monitoring server (would add metrics/logging routers)
- Development server (would add debug/introspection routers)

**For MVP evolution, address**:
- Move DefaultAPIWrapper from scripts/ to src/palaver
- Add automated tests for EventRouter and EventNetServer
- Remove sys.path manipulation with proper package structure
- Add router registration validation
- Consider abstraction layer for status endpoint

**Process success**: User-identified workflow gap led to mid-story process improvement. Updated AGENTS.md now explicit about beads requirement, preventing future mistakes. This validates the LabsNFoundries approach: discover process issues during implementation, fix immediately, document for next time.

**Stage appropriateness**: Prototype stage correct choice for this refactoring. Clean interfaces and good separation more important than comprehensive tests when establishing architecture. Tests become critical when promoting to MVP for production use.
