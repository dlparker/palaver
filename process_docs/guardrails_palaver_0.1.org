* Absolute beginning, December 27 2025 Guardrails specifics for Palaver project

This process is being developed by using it on the "palaver" subsystem of
the voice controlled personal assistant that is under development. It has
not been used at all on the project at this point, so some support will
need to be worked out.

** Beads

I have installed the beads tracking component into the Claude code environment
for this project. I have only briefly reviewed what it is and how it works
and have decided I want to use it to see if I like what it does for my
work with Claude Code. Therefore I may need Claude to help me figure out
how it fits with how I want to work.

My initial though is that it could be used for tracking Tasks, but it might
not be suitable for tracking Stories. I could be wrong about that, however,
as I know it support some sort of hierarchy of work descriptions as someone
mentioned it supports epochs.

If it does not have a hierarchical structure that can support my notion of
Stories and Tasks, then I guess Stories will need to be markdown documents.
Let's work this out and then update this document

   

** Knowing current code stages

I would like to have some kind of source marking mechanism for identifying
the Stage that I assign to a bit of code. I think the right granularity
is the class or function level, as some source files will have a mixture
of stages.

I would like Claude's advice on this. One option that seems attractive
is some sort of custom decorator, maybe using the Decorum library? I
have no experience with this so I need advice. One thing that would
be extra nice, but not necessary is if the decorator could be used
to mark classes, methods or functions for coverage. That way I
could get a quick estimate of how well I am testing code that I want
to test and ignore the rest, avoiding a manual step. Nice to have but
not required. Other suggestions are welcome.

Whatever code marking method we end up using, I'll need to do it manually
for the existing code, but as we build new code you can help me keep it
in sync.
