* Absolute beginning, December 27 2025 Guardrails specifics for Palaver project

This process is being developed by using it on the "palaver" subsystem of
the voice controlled personal assistant that is under development. It has
not been used at all on the project at this point, so some support will
need to be worked out.

** Beads

I have installed the beads tracking component into the Claude code environment
for this project. I have only briefly reviewed what it is and how it works
and have decided I want to use it to see if I like what it does for my
work with Claude Code. Therefore I may need Claude to help me figure out
how it fits with how I want to work.

My initial though is that it could be used for tracking Tasks, but it might
not be suitable for tracking Stories. I could be wrong about that, however,
as I know it support some sort of hierarchy of work descriptions as someone
mentioned it supports epochs.

If it does not have a hierarchical structure that can support my notion of
Stories and Tasks, then I guess Stories will need to be markdown documents.
Let's work this out and then update this document
