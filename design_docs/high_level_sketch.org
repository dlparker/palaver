* Main components:

1. src/palaver/recorder VAD based segmentation of audio input passed
   through Whisper.cpp to transcribe to text.
2. src/palaver/config knobs user can turn to experiment with settings
   for recorder
3. src/palaver/commands first pass at defining a structure for a
   command recognizer language
4. src/palaver/tui a basic UI to make it easier for user to play with
   settings, commands, speech styles, etc. Not a model "real" UI, just
   a lab tool
5. scripts/direct_recorder.py a trivial program that uses the recorder
   and provides simple stdin/stdout controls and reporting.
6. tests/ pytest tests, a mixture of things that need testing only to
   verify completeness of recent changes, and other tests that are
   needed to ensure that recent changes don't break working code.
