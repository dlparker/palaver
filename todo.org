1. [] Find a way to issue an end block command if audio ends with no command match. Probably should
   be in core, but implemented by command logic
2. [x] Change "Note" stuff to "Block"
3. [] Build better storage method than current files only approach
4. [] Add rescan using new storage
   
   
Immediate:

DONE Make file listener calculate the file sound duration and simulate time such that end of file time is the current time.



Core API updates:
1. [] Build an interface to the core that accepts a config dataclass
   and provides helper functions for initializing the Listener (File,
   Mic, etc), possibly other stuff
2. [X] Allow caller to select the Listener, the VAD, or the AudioMerge as the audio event source
   

Main architecture
1. [X] Move the recorder code out of the core and:
   1. [x] make it configurable
   2. [x] fix the listener name
   3. [x] Change it to store text blocks in directory
   4. [] Add a DB for tracking, listing, deleteting, etc
   5. [] Add a method to add text revisions by ID (maybe using the json meta data)
2. [x] Move MQTT out of core
   1. [] Add a combined event stream
   2. [] Add substreams to replicate original audio split

      







3. Add dynamic command loading code and call it during startup
