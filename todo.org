1. [] The command detection is too stupid for words. Only needs a match on a single word. May have
   to use an actual prefix.


1. [X] Find a way to issue an end block command if audio ends with no command match. Probably should
   be in core, but implemented by command logic
2. [X] Change "Note" stuff to "Block"
3. [X] Build rescan support into recorder
4. [X] Add rescan using new storage
   
3. Add dynamic command loading code and call it during startup
   

Main architecture
1. [X] Move the recorder code out of the core and:
   1. [X] make it configurable
   2. [X] fix the listener name
   3. [X] Change it to store text blocks in directory
   4. [] Add a DB for tracking, listing, deleteting, etc
   5. [] Add a method to add text revisions by ID (maybe using the json meta data)
