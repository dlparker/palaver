1. Move stage_markers.py to utils


1. Build net_audio.py NetAudioListener
2. Build EventClient with a ScribeAPIListener connector to AudioFollower, TextFollower and DraftFollower
3. Add --ws-listen HOST:PORT arg, update server code to have a default draft storage dir, and move MicListener setup from src to scripts
4. Setup pipeline with NetAudioListener
5. Connect to MicListener server and make sure it works 
6. Add "wait_for_drafts" mode to AudioFollower to ring buffer audio while not draft, then apply when in draft
7. Add revision support to db
8. Add db replication logic to DraftFollower
9. Add revision logic to db
10. Add revision logic to DraftFollower to save revision if draft references another (by draft_id)
11. Add revision route to fastapi (prolly can use some of broken line)

    
    
Things to maybe fix:

event_router.py

1. The handling of chunks varies based on subscription, but I don't like that 'all' does not include chunks, semantically wrong.
2. The logic in route_event that decides whether to send doesn't belong there, event filtering should be before that call
3. Note sure if the pre-buffering is correct, need to check it, and making it a parameter is questionable.
