1. Need a recorder status message emitter, maybe MQTT?
2. Need to focus on time marks.
3. Need to consider VAD attention but unrestricted recording after than, maybe
   doing both but using VAD only to find terminating silence?
4. Need to figure out how to recognized corrupted attention word, or maybe
   need to make it bigger, like "attention clerk", try it with "attention bob"
5. Find out about audio compression
6. Build mock transcriber for testing and dev work that runs fast but looks like
   an audio source.
