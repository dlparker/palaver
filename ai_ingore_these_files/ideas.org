2. Find out about audio compression
3. Need a recorder status message emitter, maybe MQTT?


Rework the text_processor
1. Generalize notes into flexible commands and doc formats (see below for detail)
2. Allow runtime setting of the prefix that is used to account for VAD tardiness
   to start saving sound, in current code that is the word "clerk". Call this
   the "attention_phrase".
3. Add rapidfuzz support to the matcher logic for both the attention_phrase and
   the CommandDoc "commad_phrase" (see below)
4. When a speech does not match any command (or the attention phrase), save it
   in a "slush_bucket". Future commands may involve using this text, allowing for
   alternate styles of user interaction.
5. Once a command is recognized, and buckets are being processed, if a bucket doesn't
   fill within "start_window" (see below), then the command is discarded and the contents
   of the command prompt and any filled buckets are moved to the current "slush_bucket"
   
Generalize from hardcode "notes" to CommandDocs
CommandDoc class API:

1. a "command_phrase" property to be used by text processor to identify this doc type as the target.
3. a list of the "SpeechBuckets" it wants filled, in the order to be filled

The SpeechBucket class provides a name and a display_name property.
The name property is for programmer use and the display_name property
is for displaying to humans. Each have to be unique so that they can
be used as dictionary keys.

The SpeechBucket class has an API that gives listener specs for parameters
in relative form. These will be relative to a global "base" definition
of these factors that can be configured at run time, so user
can adjust things to suit. The relative form is a float factor
that will be multiplied by the "base" to get the final.

For example, if the "base" value for "long speech termination silence"
is 2 seconds, and a SpeechBucket instancee has the value of 3.0, then
the silence value will be 6.0

Relative Parameters
1. segment_size - for the recorder process.
2. start_window - How long to wait for text for this bucket before
   giving up, which may reset the CommandDoc processing and lose
   any progress.
3. termination_silence - VAD setting to singnal end of bucket
   
 
So a note would be:

(numbers are examples, not meant to be final)

with Global params:
    segment_size = 10
    start_window = 1
    termination_silence = 0.5

class SimpleNote(CommandDoc):
    command_phrase = "start new note"
    speech_buckets = [
       SpeechBucket(name="simple_note_title", display_name="Title", start_window=3.0), # sometimes the title task a couple of seconds to think of
       SpeechBucket(name="simple_note_boy", display_name="Body", termination_silence=10.0, segment_size=0.5),
    ]
   


Example rapidfuzz code
    from rapidfuzz import fuzz

    string1 = "apple"
    string2 = "aple"
    similarity_score = fuzz.ratio(string1, string2)
    print(f"Similarity between '{string1}' and '{string2}': {similarity_score}")
