1. Need to consider VAD attention but unrestricted recording after than, maybe
   doing both but using VAD only to find terminating silence?
3. Rework command listener.
   1. Put everything no-matching in "slush"
   2. Check for "attention to command" using fuxx
   3. use rest of that segment as a command
      1. Try to match, if good dispatch
      2. If bad, try next segment and dont require attention
      3. If no data for 5 seconds, reset
      4. If command == "reset"
4. Need a recorder status message emitter, maybe MQTT?
5. Need to focus on time marks.
2. Find out about audio compression
